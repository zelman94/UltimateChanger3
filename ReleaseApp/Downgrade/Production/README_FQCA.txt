This "Mini-FQCA" is meant to bing the Wireless Programmer to the state that a completely produced Programmer is in, when it leaves the factory.
This is with a serial number and unique Bluetooth address.

NOte that currently, there is no settings file to load.

Perform a "mini-FQCA" by running:

WirelessProgrammerFQCASettingsOnly.cmd -which only gives settings (serial and BT addr).
or
WirelessProgrammerFQCAComplete.cmd  - which also lets you test the "Power" button and check the LEDs.
